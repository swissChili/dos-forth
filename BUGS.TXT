!! BUGS !!

- For some reason, if the word `IMMEDIATE' is defined in DICTNRY.ASM,
  it shows up in `WORDS' but cannot actually be invoked. If it is
  shortened to `IMMED' it works fine, same if it's called
  `IMMEDIAT'. However, `IMMEDIATX' doesn't work. But if it's named
  something random like `123456789' it works. Also, other words 9
  characters long work fine! This is really weird. Moving the
  definition of `IMMEDIATE' to a different location in the binary
  (padding it from the start) doesn't solve the problem.

  Update: This seems to affect a whole lot of words, including
  `>CFA'. Can't seem to find a pattern between them, e.g. `>DFA' works
  fine.
